# Joloo's Sandbox

Welcome to the Sandbox repository! This repository serves as my playground for experimenting with various web development concepts, both backend and frontend.
Whether exploring new technologies, testing out frameworks, or just learning, this is my new place to do it. There are going to be braancheeeessss

## Overview

Sandbox is designed to help me test and understand different web development concepts in a safe and isolated environment.
This repository includes examples, experiments, and projects for both frontend and backend development.
This repo is created mostly to leverage Github's branching features, providing me a way to have everything I am doing in a single repo but with differen contexts

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sandbox, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JolomiTee/SANDBOX.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd sandbox
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Depending on what you are looking for, switch branches then you may need to install dependencies for either the frontend or backend projects.

   For frontend:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

   For backend:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Project:**

   To start the development server or run the project, follow the instructions in the respective frontend or backend folders.

   For frontend:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   For backend:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Frontend Concepts

In the `frontend` directory, you can find various experiments and examples related to:

- React
- Nextjs

// More to come as soon as i know what to mess around with

Feel free to explore and add your own frontend experiments here.

## Backend Concepts

In the `backend` directory, there will be stuff you can experiment with concerning:

- Node.js and Express
- RESTful APIs
- GraphQL
- Database integrations (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Authentication and Authorization

Check out my code or create new ones to test various stuff and functionalities out.

## Folder Structure

The repository will soon be organized as follows:

```
SANDBOX/
│
├── frontend/
│   ├── [r_type] (React Type)
│   ├── [n_type] (Next Type)
│   ├── [v_type] (Vue Type)
│   └── [a_type] (Angular Type)
│
│
├── backend/
│   ├── relevant backend files and folders
│   ├── might include backends written in other langs
│   └── such as python, which i am currently interested in
│
└── branch.md
```

- `frontend/`: Contains all frontend-related experiments and projects.
- `backend/`: Contains all backend-related experiments and projects.
- `branch.md`: Contains the information about what is being done on the branch, whether a project or a test or a quick tutorial.

## Contributing
